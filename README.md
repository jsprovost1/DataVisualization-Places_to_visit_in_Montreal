# Places To See This Summer In Montreal

The following R-Markdown file is creating a nice data visualization in which you'll be able to see some of my favorite spots in Montreal during summertime. If you zoom in onto a location, you will see the name and you will be able to click on the name to guide you toward the actual website for this specific location. 

Because of the size of the HTML file, Github does not allow to visualize the code. However you will have no issue going through the R code.
To have access to the visualization, please click on this [link](https://jsprovost1.github.io/DataVisualization-Places_to_visit_in_Montreal/spots_Montreal.html).

Have a great summer!
